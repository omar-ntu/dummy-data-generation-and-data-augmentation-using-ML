# Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programme (UROP)
***Project Title: "Dummy Data Generation and Data Augmentation Using Machine Learning"***

>During one of the semesters in my second undergraduate year, I participated in my university's UROP. This was my research project, titled "Dummy Data Generation and Data Augmentation Using Machine Learning". I had just started out learning about the field of technology (which was actually the reason why I changed major to EEE after my first year) and what intrigued me the most was machine learning (ML). At this point in time, I was a complete beginner in the subject. I tried learning ML through online courses (like DeepLearning.AI's Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera) and YouTube videos, and I wanted to learn more while also gaining some hands-on experience in the field. Then, one day, I saw an e-mail by the university asking for participants in their UROP, and I thought to myself, what better way to learn than through research?
